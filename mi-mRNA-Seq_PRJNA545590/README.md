# miRNA-Seq
Since the data is paired-end, it is very unlikely to find mature miRNAs, the best thing that can happen is finding long precursors. Since miRDeep2 only does single end, I used the 1st mate of the pair which is standard. I only found 1 mature miRNA(rno-miR-466b-3p) in sample SRR9164621 with a read count of 1.
